Release Howto for pmd-build:
============================

dummy

Step by step:
-------------
1. Checkout master branch:

git clone https://github.com/pmd/build-tools.git
cd build-tools
 
2. Prepare the release (creates a new release tag).
   This will be done for you: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/examples/prepare-release.html
   Maven will ask you about the release version, the tag name and the new version. You can simply hit enter,
   to use the default values.

mvn release:clean
mvn release:prepare

3.  Wait, until release is ready. The maven plugin will directly push the tag. The tag will be
    built by [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org/pmd). After it is done, the new release
    should be available under https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/net/sourceforge/pmd/pmd-build/.
